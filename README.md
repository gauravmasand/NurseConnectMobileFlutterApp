# NeuralBytes â€“ Emergency Health Assistance App

## Project Overview
NeuralBytes is an innovative mobile application designed to provide emergency health assistance for senior citizens living alone. This app ensures immediate support during emergencies such as health issues, accidents, or falls by quickly alerting nearby nurses.

## Problem Statement
Senior citizens living alone are prone to emergencies where timely assistance is crucial. However, the existing methods of identifying and notifying the nearest healthcare professionals often lead to delays, which can worsen health outcomes.

## Solution
NeuralBytes offers a quick, automated, and efficient system that alerts nearby nurses. The application utilizes geo-location tracking, automated nurse assignment, and real-time communication to ensure faster response times.

## Key Features
- **SOS Button & Voice Activation:**  
  A physical or app-based button allows patients to trigger emergency alerts. Voice commands provide an alternative for patients unable to physically press the button.
  
- **Heart Beat Alert Integration:**  
  Continuous monitoring of vital signs through wearable devices, with automatic alerts sent in the event of abnormal heart rates.
  
- **Real-Time Nurse Tracking:**  
  Patients can track the live location of the assigned nurse and get an estimated time of arrival once the alert is accepted.
  
- **Nurse-Patient Communication:**  
  Secure in-app chat, voice, or video calls enable real-time communication between patients and nurses.
  
- **Automated Nurse Assignment:**  
  The system tracks both patients and nurses in real-time, assigning nurses based on proximity and estimated travel time.
  
- **Continuous Emergency Notifications:**  
  Notifications are continuously sent to nearby nurses until one accepts the emergency request.

## Apps Developed
We have developed two separate mobile applications:
1. **NeuralBytes for Senior Citizens**  
   - An application designed for senior citizens to send emergency alerts and communicate with nurses.
  
2. **NeuralBytes for Nurses**  
   - An application for nurses to receive emergency alerts, track their location, and communicate with patients in real time.

## Technical Stack
- **Front-End:** Flutter (Mobile app for both Patients & Nurses)  
  - Intuitive UI for seamless interaction.
  
- **Back-End:** Node.js  
  - Robust server architecture for handling emergency alerts and tracking.
  
- **Database:** Firebase  
  - Centralized database for patient data, nurse assignments, and health records.
  
- **Real-Time Geo-Location Tracking:**  
  Google Maps API for tracking and updating nurse proximity.

## Business Model
### Primary Revenue Streams:
- Subscription Plans for premium features.
- Device Sales (e.g., digital watches with health monitoring integration).
- Partnerships with hospitals, clinics, and insurance companies.

### Secondary Revenue Streams:
- Licensing the platform to healthcare providers.
- Mobile App & Web Platform subscriptions for end-users.

## Unique Value Proposition
NeuralBytes ensures the fastest response time for critical health emergencies by integrating a wearable heart rate monitor, automated nurse assignment, and continuous notification systems, providing seamless healthcare support for senior citizens.
